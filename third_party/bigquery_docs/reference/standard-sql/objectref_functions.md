GoogleSQL for BigQuery supports the following ObjectRef functions.

This topic includes functions that let you create and interact with [`ObjectRef`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref) and [`ObjectRefRuntime`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/objectref_functions#objectrefruntime) values.

An `ObjectRef` value represents a Cloud Storage object, including the object URI, size, type, and similar metadata. It also contains an authorizer, which identifies the [Cloud resource connection](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection) to use to access the Cloud Storage object from BigQuery. An `ObjectRef` value is a `STRUCT` that has the following format:

```
STRUCT {
  uri string,  // Cloud Storage object URI
  version string,  // Cloud Storage object version
  authorizer string,  // Cloud resource connection to use for object access
  details json {  // Cloud Storage managed object metadata
    gcs_metadata json {
      "content_type": string,  // for example, "image/png"
      "md5_hash": string,  // for example, "d9c38814e44028bf7a012131941d5631"
      "size": number,  // for example, 23000
      "updated": number  // for example, 1741374857000000
    }
  }
}
```

The fields in the `gcs_metadata` JSON refer to the [object metadata](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/metadata) for a Cloud Storage object.

## `OBJ.FETCH_METADATA`

```
OBJ.FETCH_METADATA(
  objectref
)
```

```
OBJ.FETCH_METADATA(
  ARRAY<objectref>
)
```

**Description**

The `OBJ.FETCH_METADATA` function returns Cloud Storage metadata for a partially populated [`ObjectRef` value](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref) .

This function lets the `ObjectRef` value use either [direct access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref#direct-access) or [delegated access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref#delegated-access) to the object.

This function still succeeds if there is a problem fetching metadata. In this case, the `details` field contains an `error` field with the error message, as shown in the following example:

```
{
  "details": {
    "errors": [{
      "code":400,
      "message":"Connection credential for projects/myproject/locations/us/connections/connection1 cannot be used. Either the connection does not exist, or the user does not have sufficient permissions to use it.",
      "source":"OBJ.FETCH_METADATA",
    }]
  }
}
```

**Definitions**

- `objectref` : A partially populated `ObjectRef` value, in which the `uri` field is populated, the `authorizer` field is optional, and the `details` field is not populated.

**Output**

If your input is a single `ObjectRef` value, then the function returns a fully populated `ObjectRef` value. The metadata is provided in the `details` field of the returned `ObjectRef` value.

If your input is an array of `ObjectRef` values, then the function returns an array of fully populated `ObjectRef` values. The metadata is provided in the `details` field of each returned `ObjectRef` value.

**Examples**

The following query populates the metadata fields for an `ObjectRef` value based on a PNG object in a publicly available Cloud Storage bucket:

```
SELECT
  OBJ.FETCH_METADATA(
    OBJ.MAKE_REF("gs://cloud-samples-data/bigquery/tutorials/cymbal-pets/images/aquaclear-aquarium-background-poster.png", "us.connection1")

```

**Limitations**

You can't have more than 20 Cloud resource connections in the project and region where your query accesses object data as `ObjectRef` values.

## `OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL`

```
OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL(
  objectref,
  mode
  [, duration]
)
```

```
OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL(
  ARRAY<objectref>,
  mode
  [, duration]
)
```

**Description**

The `OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL` function returns a JSON value that contains reference information for the input [`ObjectRef`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref) value, and also access URLs that you can use to read or modify the Cloud Storage object.

This function requires you to use [delegated access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref#delegated-access) to read the object.

If the function encounters an error, the returned JSON contains a `errors` field with the error message instead of the `access_urls` field with the access URLs. The following example shows an error message:

```
{
  "objectref": {
    "authorizer": "myproject.us.connection1",
    "uri": "gs://mybucket/path/to/file.jpg"
  },
  "errors": [{
    "code":400,
    "message":"Connection credential for projects/myproject/locations/us/connections/connection1 cannot be used. Either the connection does not exist, or the user does not have sufficient permissions to use it.",
    "source":"OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL",
  }]
}
```

**Definitions**

- `objectref` : An `ObjectRef` value that represents a Cloud Storage object.

- `mode` : A `STRING` value that identifies the type of URL that you want to be returned. The following values are supported:

  - `r` : Returns a URL that lets you read the object.
  - `rw` : Returns two URLs, one that lets you read the object, and one that lets you modify the object.

- `duration` : An optional [`INTERVAL`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#interval_type) value that specifies how long the generated access URLs remain valid. You can specify a value between 30 minutes and 6 hours. For example, you could specify `INTERVAL 2 HOUR` to generate URLs that expire after 2 hours. The default value is 6 hours.

**Output**

A JSON value or array of JSON values that contains the Cloud Storage object reference information from the input `ObjectRef` value, and also one or more URLs that you can use to access the Cloud Storage object.

The JSON output is returned in the `ObjectRefRuntime` schema:

```
obj_ref_runtime json {
  obj_ref json {
    uri string, // Cloud Storage object URI
    version string, // Cloud Storage object version
    authorizer string, // Cloud resource connection to use for object access
    details json { // Cloud Storage managed object metadata
      gcs_metadata json {
      }
    }
  }
  access_urls json {
    read_url string, // read-only signed url
    write_url string, // writeable signed url
    expiry_time string // the URL expiration time in YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS'Z' format
  }
}
```

**Example**

This example returns read URLs for all of the image objects associated with the films in the `mydataset.films` table, where the `poster` column is a struct in the `ObjectRef` schema. The URLs expire in 45 minutes.

```
SELECT
  OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL(poster, 'r', INTERVAL 45 MINUTE) AS read_url
FROM mydataset.films;
```

**Limitations**

You can't have more than 20 Cloud resource connections in the project and region where your query accesses object data as `ObjectRef` values.

## `OBJ.GET_READ_URL`

```
OBJ.GET_READ_URL(objectref)
```

**Description**

The `OBJ.GET_READ_URL` function returns a `STRUCT` value that contains a read URL that you can use to read the Cloud Storage object. The URL expires after 45 minutes.

This function requires you to use [delegated access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref#delegated-access) to read for the input `ObjectRef` value.

**Definitions**

- `objectref` : an `ObjectRef` value that represents a Cloud Storage object

**Output**

A `STRUCT` value that contains the following fields:

- `url` : a read URL that you can use to read the Cloud Storage object. If the function can't create the read URL, then this value is `NULL` .
- `status` : an error message. If the function successfully creates the read URL, then this value is `NULL` .

**Examples**

In the following example, the `mydataset.films` table has a `STRUCT` column `poster` that contains values with the `ObjectRef` schema. The following query returns a read URL for each of the image objects associated with the films:

```
SELECT
  OBJ.GET_READ_URL(poster) AS read_url
FROM mydataset.films;

/*----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+
 | read_url.url                                                   | read_url.status |
 +----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+
 | https://storage.googleapis.com/posters/poster-1.jpg?X-Goog-... | NULL            |
 +----------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------*/
```

When you run this query in Studio, the `read_url.url` column displays the images corresponding to the read URLs. To view the text of the URLs, select the **JSON** tab in the **Query results** pane.

**Limitations**

You can't have more than 20 connections in the project and region in which your query accesses object data as `ObjectRef` values.

## `OBJ.LIST`

```
OBJ.LIST(
  uri
  [, authorizer ]
)
```

**Description**

The `OBJ.LIST` function returns a table of metadata and `ObjectRef` values for files stored in Cloud Storage. `OBJ.LIST` lets you perform ad-hoc discovery and analysis of unstructured data. The Cloud Storage data can include documents, images, and audio. The `OBJ.LIST` function can discover objects across all [Cloud Storage classes](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes) .

Using `OBJ.LIST` replaces the need to manually construct `ObjectRef` values. You can quickly add Cloud Storage objects into AI functions to build ETL pipelines that handle converting unstructured data to structured data. If you require a persistent, self-updating table that continuously tracks new objects that arrive in a bucket over time, you should create a standard [BigQuery object table](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/object-table-introduction) instead.

For more information, see [Work with `ObjectRef` values](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref) .

**Definitions**

- `uri` : a `STRING` value that contains the URI for the Cloud Storage object, for example, `gs://mybucket/flowers/12345.jpg` . Scalar subqueries and string manipulation functions such as `CONCAT` aren't supported.

  You can use one asterisk ( `*` ) wildcard character in each path to limit the objects included in the results. For example, if the bucket contains several types of unstructured data, you could list only PDF objects by specifying `gs://bucket_name/*.pdf` . For more information, see [Wildcard support for URIs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/external-data-cloud-storage#wildcard-support) .

  > **Note:** The `OBJ.LIST` function doesn't support uris that end in a slash or uris that contain consecutive slashes. For example, uris such as `gs://mybucket/flowers/` and `gs://mybucket/flowers//12345.jpg` return an error.

- `authorizer` : a `STRING` value that contains the [Cloud Resource connection](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection) used for [delegated access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref#delegated-access) to the Cloud Storage object. Your data administrator needs to set up the permissions to use this connection. If omitted, the returned ObjectRef uses [direct access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref#direct-access) .

**Output**

A table with metadata that represents the objects found in Cloud Storage. The table includes the following columns:

- `uri` : a `STRING` value that contains the Cloud Storage URI of the object.
- `content_type` : a `STRING` value that contains the MIME type of the object, for example, `image/jpeg` or `application/pdf` .
- `size` : an `INT64` value that contains the object size in bytes.
- `md5_hash` : a `STRING` value that contains the MD5 hash of the object.
- `updated` : a `TIMESTAMP` value that contains the time the object was last updated.
- `metadata` : an `ARRAY<STRUCT<name STRING, value STRING>>` value that contains additional Cloud Storage metadata.
- `generation` : an `INT64` value that identifies the [version of an object](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/metadata#generation-number) , and exists for every object, regardless of whether a bucket uses Object Versioning.
- `ref` : an `ObjectRef` value that represents the object. This value can be passed to other `OBJ` and `AI` functions.

**Examples**

The examples demonstrate how to use `OBJ.LIST` to perform spontaneous analysis of unstructured data. These examples omit the `authorizer` argument, which means that the queries use [direct access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref#direct-access) . If your environment requires [delegated access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref#delegated-access) , add the `authorizer` argument to the query.

The following query uses the wildcard character (\*) to discover specific file types, and it uses the `AI.IF` function to filter unstructured data. This query lists only the PNG files that contain an image of a dog.

```
SELECT
  uri,
  content_type,
  size
FROM
  OBJ.LIST('gs://cloud-samples-data/bigquery/tutorials/cymbal-pets/images/*.png')
WHERE
  AI.IF(('Does this image contain a dog?', ref))
ORDER BY
  uri;

/*----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+--------+
 | uri                                                            | content_type | size   |

 +----------------------------------------------------------------+--------------+--------*/
```

The following example combines the `OBJ.LIST` and `AI.GENERATE` functions with the `output_schema` parameter to build an unstructured-to-structured data pipeline using a single query. This example reads raw images and extracts strictly typed properties into standard BigQuery columns without creating a persistent object table.

```
SELECT
  uri,
  result.animal_type,
  result.item_color
FROM (
  SELECT
    uri,
    AI.GENERATE(
      ("What type of animal is this pet product for, and what is its primary color?", ref),
      output_schema => 'animal_type STRING, item_color STRING'
    ) AS result
  FROM
    OBJ.LIST('gs://cloud-samples-data/bigquery/tutorials/cymbal-pets/images/*.png')
);

The following example uses the `AI.IF` function to review a directory of unstructured files for policy violations based on their semantic, visual, or audio content. This query reviews a folder of product manuals and returns only the files that are missing crucial safety warnings.

```
SELECT
  uri
FROM
  OBJ.LIST('gs://cloud-samples-data/bigquery/tutorials/cymbal-pets/documents/*')
WHERE
  AI.IF(('Determine if this product manual is missing standard choking hazard safety warnings.', ref))

**Limitations**

The following object table limitations apply to the `OBJ.LIST` function. Because `OBJ.LIST` dynamically generates object metadata, it shares many of the same underlying behaviors and limitations as [object tables](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/object-table-introduction) .

- **Locations** : If you use a BigQuery connection, the connection's location and the query location must be compatible with the Cloud Storage bucket's region.
- **VPC Service Controls** : Access to Cloud Storage data is governed by your organization's [VPC Service Controls perimeters](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/service-perimeters) .

## `OBJ.MAKE_REF`

This function supports the following syntaxes:

```
OBJ.MAKE_REF(
  uri
  [, authorizer ]
  [, version => version_value ]
  [, details => gcs_metadata_json ]
)
```

```
OBJ.MAKE_REF(
  objectref_json
)
```

When you use this syntax, the top-level `authorizer` argument overwrites any `authorizer` that you specify in the `objectref` argument.

```
OBJ.MAKE_REF(
  objectref,
  authorizer
)
```

**Description**

Use the `OBJ.MAKE_REF` function to create an [`ObjectRef` value](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref) that contains reference information for a Cloud Storage object. You can use this function in workflows similar to the following:

1.  Transform an object.
2.  Save it to Cloud Storage using a writable signed URL that you created by using the [`OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL` function](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/objectref_functions#objget_access_url) .
3.  Create an `ObjectRef` value for the transformation output by using the `OBJ.MAKE_REF` function.
4.  Save the `ObjectRef` value by writing it to a table column.

**Definitions**

- `uri` : A `STRING` value that contains the URI for the Cloud Storage object, for example, `gs://mybucket/flowers/12345.jpg` . You can also specify a column name in place of a string literal. For example, if you have URI data in a `uri` field, you can specify `OBJ.MAKE_REF(uri, "myproject.us.conn")` .

- `authorizer` : A `STRING` value that contains the [Cloud Resource connection](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection) used for [delegated access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref#delegated-access) to the Cloud Storage object. Your data administrator needs to set up the permissions to use this connection. If omitted, the returned ObjectRef uses [direct access](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref#direct-access) .

- `version_value` : A `STRING` value that represents the Cloud Storage object version.

- `gcs_metadata_json` : A `JSON` value that represents Cloud Storage metadata, using the following schema:

  ```
  gcs_metadata JSON {
      "content_type": string,
      "md5_hash": string,
      "size": number,
      "updated": number
  }
  ```

- `objectref_json` : A `JSON` value that represents a Cloud Storage object, using the following schema:

  ```
  obj_ref json {
    uri string,
    [, authorizer string ]
    [, version string]
    [, details gcs_metadata_json ]
  }
  ```

Validation is performed on the formatting of the input, but not the content.

**Output**

An `ObjectRef` value.

- If you provide a URI as input, then the output is a reference to the Cloud Storage object identified by the URI.
- If you provide an ObjectRef JSON value, then the output contains all of the input information formatted as an ObjectRef value.
- If you provide an ObjectRef value and authorizer, then the output contains the input ObjectRef value with an updated authorizer.

**Examples**

The following example creates an `ObjectRef` value using a URI and a Cloud resource connection as input:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `mydataset.movies` AS (
  SELECT
    f.title,
    f.director
    OBJ.MAKE_REF(p.uri, 'asia-south2.storage_connection') AS movie_poster
  FROM mydataset.movie_posters p
  join mydataset.films f
  using(title)
  where region = 'US'
  and release_year = 2024
);
```

The following example creates an `ObjectRef` value using JSON input:

```
OBJ.MAKE_REF(JSON '{"uri": "gs://cloud-samples-data/bigquery/tutorials/cymbal-pets/images/aquaclear-aquarium-background-poster.png", "authorizer": "asia-south2.storage_connection"}');
```

The following example creates a new `ObjectRef` value with an updated authorizer:

```
SELECT
  OBJ.MAKE_REF(movie_poster,
               authorizer=>'asia-south2.new_connection') AS movie_poster_updated
FROM mydataset.movies
```

**Limitations**

You can't have more than 20 Cloud resource connections in the project and region where your query accesses object data as `ObjectRef` values.
