# BigQuery locations

This page explains the concept of *location* and the different regions where data can be stored and processed. Pricing for storage and analysis is also defined by location of data and reservations. For more information about pricing for locations, see [BigQuery pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) . To learn how to set the location for your dataset, see [Create datasets](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets) . For information about reservation locations, see [Managing reservations in different regions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#manage_reservations_in_different_regions) .

For more information about how the BigQuery Data Transfer Service uses location, see [Data location and transfers](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/dts-locations) .

## Locations and regions

BigQuery provides two types of data and compute locations:

- A *region* is a specific geographic place, such as London.

- A *multi-region* is a large geographic area, such as the United States or Europe, that contains many unique and discrete regions. Multi-region locations can provide larger quotas than single regions, but multi-regions don't provide regional redundancy. Data is stored in a single region and compute is only provided within that region. For cross-region redundancy BigQuery offers [managed disaster recovery](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/managed-disaster-recovery) .

For either location type, BigQuery automatically stores copies of your data in two different zones within a single region in the selected location. Multi-regions are considered separate from other regions, even when located within the same zone. For more information about data availability and durability, see [Disaster planning](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reliability-intro#disaster_planning) .

## Supported locations

BigQuery datasets can be stored in the following regions and multi-regions. For more information about regions and zones, see [Geography and regions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/geography-and-regions) .

### Regions

The following table lists the regions in the Americas where BigQuery is available.

### Multi-regions

> **Note:** Later this year, BigQuery will stop using the term *multi-region* . Instead, the `US` and `EU` region names will be included in the list of single regions and will colocate with the `us-central1` and `europe-west4` regions respectively. There is no change to existing data residency.

The following table lists the multi-regions where BigQuery is available. When you select a multi-region, you let BigQuery select a single region within the multi-region where your data is stored and processed.

| **Multi-region description**                                                                                                   | **Multi-region name** |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Data centers within [member states](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries_en) of the European Union <sup>1</sup> | `EU`                  |
| Data centers in the United States <sup>2</sup>                                                                                 | `US`                  |

> **Note:** Selecting a multi-region location does not provide cross-region replication or regional redundancy, so there is no increase in dataset availability in the event of a regional outage. Data is stored in a single region within the geographic location.

<sup>1</sup> Data located in the `EU` multi-region is only stored in one of the following locations: `europe-west1` (Belgium) or `europe-west4` (Netherlands). The exact location in which the data is stored and processed is determined automatically by BigQuery.

<sup>2</sup> Data located in the `US` multi-region is only stored in one of the following locations: `us-central1` (Iowa), `us-west1` (Oregon), or `us-central2` (Oklahoma). The exact location in which the data is stored and processed is determined automatically by BigQuery.

## BigQuery Studio code asset locations

BigQuery Studio lets you save, share, and manage versions of code assets such as [notebooks](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/programmatic-analysis) and [saved queries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/saved-queries-introduction) .

## BigQuery Omni locations

BigQuery Omni processes queries in the same location as the dataset that contains the tables you're querying. After you create the dataset, the location cannot be changed. Your data resides within your AWS or Azure account. BigQuery Omni regions support Enterprise edition reservations and on-demand compute (analysis) pricing. For more information about editions, see [Introduction to BigQuery editions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/editions-intro) .

## BigQuery ML locations

The following sections describe supported locations for BigQuery ML models.

### Locations for remote models

This section contains information about supported locations for [remote models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-remote-model) , and about where remote model processing occurs.  

#### Regional locations

See the following documentation for supported locations for remote models over Google models and partner models:

- For Gemini model and embedding model supported regions, see [Google model endpoint locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations#google_model_endpoint_locations) .
- For Claude, Llama, and Mistral AI model supported regions, see [Google Cloud partner model endpoint locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations#genai-partner-models) .

The following table shows which regions are supported for remote models over Cloud AI services and custom models deployed to Agent Platform. The column name indicates the type of remote model.

If the dataset in which you are creating the remote model is in a single region, the Agent Platform model endpoint must be in the same region. If you specify the model endpoint URL, use the endpoint in the same region as the dataset. For example, if the dataset is in the `us-central1` region, then specify the endpoint `https://us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myproject/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/<target_model>` . If you specify the model name, BigQuery ML automatically chooses the endpoint in the correct region.

#### Multi-regional locations

Multi-regional support for remote models is as follows:

- Gemini models are supported in the `US` and `EU` multi-regions.
- Claude, Llama, and Mistral AI models in the `US` multi-region can use the Agent Platform endpoint for any single region within the `US` multi-region. Claude, Llama, and Mistral AI models in the `EU` multi-region can use the Agent Platform endpoint for any single region within the `EU` multi-region except for `eu-west2` and `eu-west6` .
- Vertex AI deployed models aren't supported in either multi-region.
- [Cloud AI services](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-remote-model-service) are supported in the `US` and `EU` multi-regions.

If the dataset in which you are creating the remote model is in a multi-region, then the Agent Platform model endpoint must be in a region within that multi-region. For example, if the dataset is in the `eu` multi-region, then you could specify the URL for the `europe-west1` region endpoint, `https://europe-west1-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/myproject/locations/europe-west1/publishers/google/models/<target_model>` . If you specify the model name instead of the endpoint URL, BigQuery ML defaults to using the `europe-west4` endpoint for datasets in the `eu` multi-region, and to using the `us-central1` endpoint for datasets in the `us` multi-region.

#### Global endpoint

For [supported Gemini models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations#supported_models) , you can specify the [global endpoint](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/locations#use_the_global_endpoint) .

The global endpoint covers the entire world and provides higher availability and reliability than a single region. Using the global endpoint for your requests can improve overall availability while reducing resource exhausted (429) errors, which occur when you exceed your quota for a regional endpoint. If you want to use Gemini 2.0+ in a region where it isn't available, you can avoid migrating your data to a different region by using the global endpoint instead. You can only use a model deployed to the global endpoint with the `AI.GENERATE_TEXT` function.

Don't use the global endpoint if you have requirements for the data processing location, because when you use the global endpoint, you can't control or know the region where your processing requests are handled.

#### Processing locations for Google models and partner models

For information about processing locations used by Google models hosted in Agent Platform, see [ML processing for Google Cloud models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/data-residency#ml-processing-google-models) . This information covers models deployed to regions or multi-regions. Models that use the global endpoint don't guarantee any particular processing location.

For information about processing locations used by partner models hosted in Agent Platform, see [ML processing for Google Cloud partner models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/data-residency#ml-processing-partner-models) .

### Locations for non-remote models

#### Multi-regional locations

All supported models other than remote models are supported in the `US` and `EU` multi-regions.

Data located in the `EU` multi-region is not stored in the `europe-west2` (London) or `europe-west6` (Zürich) data centers.

Vertex AI Model Registry integration is supported only for single region integrations. If you send a multi-region BigQuery ML model to the Model Registry, then it is converted to a regional model in Vertex AI. A BigQuery ML multi-region US model is synced to Agent Platform `us-central1` and a BigQuery ML multi-region EU model is synced to Agent Platform `europe-west4` . For single region models, there are no changes.

#### Processing locations

For models other than remote models, BigQuery ML processes and stages data in the same location as the dataset that contains the data.

BigQuery ML stores your data in the selected location in accordance with the [Service Specific Terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms#13-google-bigquery-service) .

## BigQuery SQL translator and migration lineage locations

When migrating data from your legacy data warehouse into BigQuery, you can use several SQL translators to translate your SQL queries into GoogleSQL or other supported SQL dialects. These include the [interactive SQL translator](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/interactive-sql-translator) , the [SQL translation API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/api-sql-translator) , and the [batch SQL translator](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/batch-sql-translator) .

You can also use the [migration lineage service](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/migration/migration-lineage) to visualize the data flow in your source database to help you plan a data warehouse migration.

The BigQuery SQL translators and the lineage service are available in the following processing locations:

## Specify locations

To ensure that BigQuery queries are stored in a specific region or multi-region, specify the location with the job request. Specifying the location ensures that the query is run in the correct location when you use the global BigQuery endpoint.

If you don't specify the location, queries might be temporarily stored in BigQuery router logs when the query is used for determining the processing location in BigQuery.

If the [project](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/resource-hierarchy#projects) has a capacity-based reservation in a region other than the `US` and the query does not reference any tables or other resources contained within datasets, then you must explicitly specify the location of the capacity-based reservation when submitting the job. Capacity-based commitments are tied to a location, such as `US` or `EU` . If you run a job outside the location of your capacity, pricing for that job automatically shifts to on-demand pricing.

You can specify the location to run a job explicitly in the following ways:

- When you query data using the Google Cloud console in the query editor, click settings **More \> Query settings** , expand **Advanced options** , and then select your **Data location** .
- When you write a SQL query, set the [`@@location` system variable](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/system-variables) in the first statement of your query.
- When you use the bq command-line tool, supply the `--location` [global flag](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#global_flags) and set the value to your location.
- When you use the API, specify your region in the `location` property in the `jobReference` section of the [job resource](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs) .

BigQuery returns an error if the specified location does not match the location of the datasets in the request. The location of every dataset involved in the request, including those read from and those written to, must match the location of the job as inferred or specified.

Single-region locations don't match multi-region locations, even where the single-region location is contained within the multi-region location. Therefore, a query will be run as a [global query](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/global-queries) if the location includes both a single-region location and a multi-region location. For example, if a job's location is set to `US` , the job will be a global query if it references a dataset in `us-central1` . Likewise, a job that references one dataset in `US` and another dataset in `us-central1` will be a global query. This is also true for `JOIN` statements with tables in both a region and a multi-region.

[Dynamic queries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/procedural-language#execute_immediate) aren't parsed until they execute, so they can't be used to automatically determine the region of a query.

## Default location

If you don't [explicitly specify a location](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations#specify_locations) , the location is determined in one of the following ways:

- The location of the datasets referenced in the request. For example, if a query references a table or view in a dataset stored in the `asia-northeast1` region, the query job runs in `asia-northeast1` .
- The region specified for a connection referenced in a request.
- The location of a destination table.

If the location isn't explicitly specified, and it can't be determined from the resources in the request, the default location is used. If default location isn't set, the job runs in the `US` multi-region.

For more information about configuring the default location, see [Specify global settings](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/default-configuration#global-settings) .

## Locations, reservations, and jobs

Capacity commitments are a regional resource. When you buy slots, those slots are limited to a specific region or multi-region. If your only capacity commitment is in the `EU` then you can't create a reservation in the `US` . When you create a reservation, you specify a location (region) and a number of slots. Those slots are pulled from your capacity commitment in that region.

Likewise, when you run a job in a region, it only uses a reservation if the location of the job matches the location of a reservation, unless the job is a [global query](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/global-queries) . For example, if you assign a reservation to a project in the `EU` and run a query in that project on a dataset located in the `US` , then that query is not run on your `EU` reservation. In the absence of any `US` reservation, the job is run as on-demand.

## Location considerations

When you choose a location for your data, consider the following:

### Cloud Storage

You can interact with Cloud Storage data using BigQuery in the following ways:

- [Query Cloud Storage data](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations#query-storage-data-location) using BigLake or non-BigLake external tables
- [Load Cloud Storage data into BigQuery](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations#load-data-location-considerations)

#### Query Cloud Storage data

When you query data in Cloud Storage by using a [BigLake](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/query-cloud-storage-using-biglake) or a [non-BigLake external table](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/query-cloud-storage-data) , the data you query must be colocated with your BigQuery dataset, otherwise the query incurs [data transfer charges](https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing#network-buckets) . For example:

- [Single region bucket](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#location-r) : If your BigQuery dataset is in the Warsaw ( `europe-central2` ) region, the corresponding Cloud Storage bucket must also be in the Warsaw region, or any Cloud Storage dual-region that includes Warsaw. If your BigQuery dataset is in the `US` multi-region, then the Cloud Storage bucket can be in the Iowa ( `us-central1` ) single region, or any dual-region that includes Iowa. Queries from any other single region incur data transfer charges, even if the bucket is in a location that is contained within the multi-region of the dataset. For example, if the external tables are in the `US` multi-region and the Cloud Storage bucket is in Oregon ( `us-west1` ), the job incurs data transfer charges.

  If your BigQuery dataset is in the `EU` multi-region, then the Cloud Storage bucket can be in the Netherlands ( `europe-west4` ) single region or any dual-region that includes Netherlands ( `europe-west4` ). Queries from any other single region incur data transfer fees, even if the bucket is in a location that is contained within the multi-region of the dataset. For example, if the external tables are in the `EU` multi-region and the Cloud Storage bucket is in Warsaw ( `europe-central2` ), the job incurs data transfer charges.

- [Dual-region bucket](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#location-dr) : If your BigQuery dataset is in the Tokyo ( `asia-northeast1` ) region, the corresponding Cloud Storage bucket must be in the Tokyo region, or in a dual-region that includes Tokyo, like the `ASIA1` dual-region.

  If the Cloud Storage bucket is in the `NAM4` dual-region or any dual-region that includes the Iowa( `us-central1` ) region, the corresponding BigQuery dataset can be in the `US` multi-region or in the Iowa( `us-central1` ).

  If Cloud Storage bucket is in the `EUR4` dual-region or any dual-region that includes the Netherlands ( `europe-west4` ) region, the corresponding BigQuery dataset can be in the `EU` multi-region or in the Netherlands ( `europe-west4` ).

- [Multi-region bucket](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations#location-mr) : Using multi-region dataset locations with multi-region Cloud Storage buckets is **not** recommended for external tables, because external query performance depends on minimal latency and optimal network bandwidth.

  If your BigQuery dataset is in the `US` multi-region, the corresponding Cloud Storage bucket must be in a dual-region that includes Iowa ( `us-central1` ), like the `NAM4` dual-region, or in a custom dual-region that includes Iowa ( `us-central1` ).

  If your BigQuery dataset is in the `EU` multi-region, the corresponding Cloud Storage bucket must be in a dual-region that includes Netherlands ( `europe-west4` ), like the `EUR4` dual-region, or in a custom dual-region that includes Netherlands ( `europe-west4` ) .

For more information about supported Cloud Storage locations, see [Bucket locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-locations) in the Cloud Storage documentation.

#### Load Cloud Storage data into BigQuery

When you load data from Cloud Storage, the data that you load must be colocated with your BigQuery dataset, otherwise the load job incurs data transfer charges.

For more information about load data transfer charges, see the [Query Cloud Storage data](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations#query-storage-data-location) section, as the same guidance applies to both batch loads and queries.

For more information, see [Batch loading data](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data) .

### Bigtable

You must consider location when querying data from Bigtable or exporting data to Bigtable.

#### Query Bigtable data

When you [query data in Bigtable](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/external-data-bigtable) through a BigQuery [external table](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/external-tables) , your Bigtable instance must be in the same location as your BigQuery dataset:

- Single region: If your BigQuery dataset is in the Belgium ( `europe-west1` ) regional location, the corresponding Bigtable instance must be in the Belgium region.
- Multi-region: Because external query performance depends on minimal latency and optimal network bandwidth, using multi-region dataset locations is **not** recommended for external tables on Bigtable.

For more information about supported Bigtable locations, see [Bigtable locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/locations) .

#### Export data to Bigtable

- If your BigQuery dataset is in a multi-region, your [Bigtable app profile](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/app-profiles) must be configured to route data to a Bigtable cluster within that multi-region. For example, if your BigQuery dataset is in the `US` multi-region, the Bigtable cluster can be located in the `us-west1` (Oregon) region, which is within the United States.
- If your BigQuery dataset is in a single region, your [Bigtable app profile](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/app-profiles) must be configured to route data to a Bigtable cluster in the same region. For example, if your BigQuery dataset is in the `asia-northeast1` (Tokyo) region, your Bigtable cluster must also be in the `asia-northeast1` (Tokyo) region.

### Google Drive

Location considerations do not apply to [Google Drive](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/external-data-drive) external data sources.

### Cloud SQL

When you [query data in Cloud SQL](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/cloud-sql-federated-queries) through a BigQuery [federated query](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/federated-queries-intro) , your Cloud SQL instance must be in the same location as your BigQuery dataset.

- Single region: If your BigQuery dataset is in the Belgium ( `europe-west1` ) regional location, the corresponding Cloud SQL instance must be in the Belgium region.
- Multi-region: If your BigQuery dataset is in the `US` multi-region, the corresponding Cloud SQL instance must be in a single region in the US geographic area.

For more information about supported Cloud SQL locations, see [Cloud SQL locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/federated-queries-intro#supported_regions) .

### Spanner

When you [query data in Spanner](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/spanner-federated-queries) through a BigQuery [federated query](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/federated-queries-intro) , your Spanner instance must be in the same location as your BigQuery dataset.

- Single region: If your BigQuery dataset is in the Belgium ( `europe-west1` ) regional location, the corresponding Spanner instance must be in the Belgium region.
- Multi-region: If your BigQuery dataset is in the `US` multi-region, the corresponding Spanner instance must be in a single region in the US geographic area.

For more information about supported Spanner locations, see [Spanner locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/federated-queries-intro#supported_regions) .

### Analysis tools

Colocate your BigQuery dataset with your [analysis tools](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/query-overview) :

- [Managed Service for Apache Spark](https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/overview) : When you query BigQuery datasets using a [BigQuery connector](https://docs.cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/connectors/bigquery) , your BigQuery dataset should be colocated with your Managed Service for Apache Spark cluster.

Managed Service for Apache Spark is supported in all [Compute Engine locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#available) .

- [Vertex AI Workbench](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/introduction) : When you query BigQuery datasets using [Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/programmatic-analysis#other_programmatic_analysis_solutions) in Vertex AI Workbench, your BigQuery dataset should be colocated with your Vertex AI Workbench instance.

View the [supported Vertex AI Workbench locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/locations#vertex-ai-workbench-locations) .

### Data management plans

Develop a data management plan:

- If you choose a regional storage resource such as a BigQuery dataset or a Cloud Storage bucket, develop a plan for [geographically managing your data](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/geography-and-regions#geographic_management_of_data) .

## Restrict locations

You can restrict the locations in which your datasets can be created by using the [Organization Policy Service](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview) . For more information, see [Restricting resource locations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/defining-locations) and [Resource locations supported services](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/defining-locations-supported-services#bigquery) .

## Dataset security

To control access to datasets in BigQuery, see [Controlling access to datasets](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/control-access-to-resources-iam) . For information about data encryption, see [Encryption at rest](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/encryption-at-rest) .
